vendorlibs - Dragonfly Development's Vendor Libs CodeIgniter Add-On
http://code.google.com/p/dd-ci-vendorlibs/


vendorlibs for CodeIgniter is intended to allow for easily adding third party
(vendor) libraries to the include path.

The implementation involves a pre-system hook and a standardized placement
of vendor libraries.

    APPPATH . 'vendors'
    BASEDIR . 'vendors'

Every directory inside of either of these two directories will be added
to the PHP include path. For example:

    system/application/vendors/fancy-orm/Orm.php

In this case, 'system/application/vendors/fancy-orm' will be added to the
include path and one will be able to require 'Orm.php' with either of the
following:

    require 'Orm.php';
    require 'fancy-orm/Orm.php';


Inspired by CakePHP's Vendor concept.
